Meteor detection on the camera network for meteor surveillance managed by the <a href="https://press.exoss.org/ ">EXOSS Project</a>. Proposed training and testing on separate regions to account for distribution shift. Used confidence calibration to select the 60% most confident images and obtain 98% accuracy in this subset.
