Received a grant to develop a model for detecting meteors in camera images. Proposed training and testing on separate regions to account for distribution shift. Used confidence calibration to select 60\% of the images and obtain 98\% accuracy in this subset.Presented at the Latin American Meeting of Artificial Intelligence and published  at ICONIP.
