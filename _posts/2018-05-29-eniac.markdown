Used pre-trained Resnets for the problem of detecting meteors. The best model achieved an error rate of 0.04 and an F1 score of 0.94. Different approaches for transfer learning were tested, revealing that the choice of a proper pre-training dataset (Fashion-MNIST) can provide better off-the-shelf features and lead to better results.
